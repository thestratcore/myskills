# myskills

A curated collection of [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code) / Codex **Agent Skills** used across Stratcore projects. Each folder is a self-contained skill — a `SKILL.md` describing when it triggers and how it behaves, plus any supporting scripts, templates, and reference files the skill needs.

## About

Skills extend an AI coding agent with reusable, domain-specific expertise. Instead of re-explaining a workflow every time, the agent loads the matching skill on demand and follows its instructions — whether that's writing an article in a defined voice, modeling a Power BI dataset, or building an MCP server. This repository is Stratcore's working toolbox of such skills, spanning content creation, web and app development, data and BI, and knowledge-base operations. Drop a folder into your agent's skills directory to use it.
